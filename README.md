- Always keeps the latest backup
- Easy reversion using the "Revert Last Change" button

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Search Options**:
   - Regular expression support for advanced pattern matching
   - Optional case-sensitivity
2. **File Access**:
   - Files must not be locked by other programs
   - User must have read/write permissions
   - Sufficient disk space needed for backup creation
3. **Text Encoding**: Files should use UTF-8 encoding
4. **Large Files**: Processing speed depends on file size and system capabilities

## üîí Safety Features

- One-click revert functionality
- File type validation
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Read/write permission checking
- Binary file detection

## üêõ Troubleshooting

1. **"File appears to be binary or corrupted"**

2. **"No permission to access file"**
   - Check file permissions
   - Run as administrator if necessary

3. **"File is locked"**
   - Close any programs using the file
   - Check if file is marked as read-only

4. **"Invalid regular expression"**
   - Check your regex pattern syntax
   - Disable regex mode for literal string matching
