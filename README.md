## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Case Sensitivity**: All text searches are case-sensitive
2. **File Access**:
   - Files must not be locked by other programs
   - User must have read/write permissions
   - Sufficient disk space needed for backup creation
3. **Text Encoding**: Files should use UTF-8 encoding
4. **Large Files**: Processing speed depends on file size and system capabilities
